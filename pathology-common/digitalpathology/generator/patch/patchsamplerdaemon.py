    """
    Create a message processing loop that can be executed in a separate thread or process. The loop can create a patch sampler and extract patches from an image.

    Args:
        command_pipe (multiprocessing.Connection): Child end of a pipe of inter-process communication. Dictionary messages accepted.
            The message is identified by the 'command' key. Accepted command values:
                'create': Initialize a sampler for the image. Further keys expected: 'source'.
                'remove': Remove the sampler for the image. Further keys expected: 'source'.
                'random': Initialize random number generators.
                'hook': Configure the data adapter. Further keys expected: 'adapter'.
                'sample': Sample patches. Further keys expected: 'count' and 'shape'.
                'stop': Quit processing loop.
                'ping': Request a 'ready' response.
            Further keys that are accepted:
                'source': PatchSource for 'create', 'remove' and 'sample' messages.
                'stat': Allow missing stat files, and create them if necessary.
                'spacing': Mask pixel spacing to use.
                'seed': Random number generator seed.
                'tolerance': Pixel spacing tolerance with the 'create' command.
                'channels': Channel list to configure with the 'create' command.
                'counts': List of number of patches to extract per label index.
                'shapes': Dictionary mapping level to (rows, columns) patch shape with 'sample' command.
                'mode': Label generation mode: 'central', 'synthesize' or 'load'.
        response_queue (multiprocessing.Queue): Queue where the responses are sent.
            Sent responses:
                'done': Answer for the 'create' or 'remove' commands.
                'pong: Answer for the 'ping' command.
                'error': Error occurred.
                'data': The response contains the requested data.
            Further keys in the messages:
                'pid': The PID of this process. It is attached to every response message.
                'exception': Exception object sent with 'error' messages.
                'trace': Traceback information for the exception.
                'patches': numpy.ndarray of patches attached to 'data' messages.
                'labels': numpy.ndarray of labels attached to 'data' messages.
        poll_timeout (int): Seconds to wait for a message. Safeguard against hanging.
